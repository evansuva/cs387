Applications of Symmetric Ciphers
=================================

[ Recap ]

Unit 1 we learned about symmetric ciphers; for the rest of the course,
we are nearly always going to view our symmetric ciphers are a black
boxes that provide encrypt and descrypt functions.

We assume:

   k   -> c
   m 

k is randomly selected from |K|.

Generating Keys
===============
 
Randomness


physically random events

/dev/random


Pseudo-Random Number Generation: Algorithms for Producing "Random"
Numbers

"Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits
is, of course, in a state of sin." - John von Neumann



unpredictability: 
   For numbers in range 0...2^n-1, an observer with the first m - 1
   numbers, cannot guess the mth with probability better than 1/2^n.
